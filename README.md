# Python Libraries – Personal Practice

This repository is **only for my personal learning and practice** while building skills in Python libraries.

I use this space to experiment, make mistakes, and improve through regular hands-on coding.

## Libraries I’m Practicing

* **NumPy** – arrays, numerical operations, and logic
* **Pandas** – data handling and practice tasks
* **Matplotlib** – basic plotting and visualization
* **Seaborn** – simple and clean visualizations



## What This Repo Contains

* Practice scripts and notebooks
* Small mini projects
* Trial-and-error code
* Notes through code comments



## Purpose

* Practice consistently
* Strengthen fundamentals
* Gain confidence using Python libraries
* Prepare myself for advanced topics later



## How I Use This Repo

* Write code regularly
* Modify examples and test ideas
* Track my learning progress over time



📌 This repository is meant for **self-practice and growth**, not for showcasing.
